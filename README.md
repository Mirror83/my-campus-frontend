# MyCampus frontend
MyCampus is a platform that makes it easy for students to find and interact with clubs and societies within JKUAT that interest them. This interaction is facilitated by blog and event posts delivered through the platform.

This is the front end of the website and it is created using React, RTK(Redux Toolkit), shad-cn, and React Router. The repository was created using the redux template for Vite.

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start the development server and open the website on a browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner

# Local setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies defined in `package.json`
3. Run `npm start` and verify that the app builds successfully.
4. Edit the code as needed.
