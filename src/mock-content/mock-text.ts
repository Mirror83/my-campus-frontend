  Hi there,
</h2>
<p>
  this space is where you'll write <em>your</em> story. You can have:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    a bullet list with one …
  </li>
  <li>
    … or two list items (or more).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Or, a code block:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body {
  display: none;
}</code></pre>
<p>
  and more, to help you convey your message. Give it a try and click a little bit around. And when you're 
  ready, erase this and start from a fresh canvas.
</p>

 The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks,
 and then starting on the first one.”
